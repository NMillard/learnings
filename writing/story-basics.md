# How stories are structured

## Narrative structure

Be concious about how the story is told. Determine the key conflicts, main characters, setting and events.  
Think about what happens at which stages.  

### The setup
Act one. Introduce all main charcters and their purpose, current situation, characterization, etc.  
Introduce the problem. The rest of the story should tackle this problem.  

### The Conflict
Act two. Bulk of the story. Setting things in motion.  
Major change is introduced, controversy is created and opinions are voiced.  

### Resolution
Third act. Forced to confront the problem. Let all the elements of a story come together.  
Pose a question or solution.  


## Formatting is everything

No one likes to read poorly formatted stories.  
Pay attention to how visually pleasing your story is.
