## Setting expectations
Make the following bullets clear when delegating a task or during project on-boarding.
- Task  
  Define exactly what the task or engagement is about.
- Objectives  
  What is accomplished by doing the task, why it's important, and how it moves us closer to the end-goal.
- Timeline  
  What is the timeframe expectations and are there anything that might prevent us from making it happen.
- Expected results  
  Define any expectations up-front and clarify misunderstandings and assumptions.
- Supporting elements  
  Provide any resource that may help understand and complete the task on time and to the desired quality level.


## Giving feedback
Give feedback on an ongoing basis in day-to-day work. Setup regular check-ins to give feedback and follow-up.
  
Follow this pattern:
- Observation  
  Describe some specific instance, behavior, deliverable, etc.
- Impact  
  Articulate how that impacts X. It could be in terms of relationships, quality, risk, etc.
- Requested change  
  Explain what you'd like to be different.

  Before giving feedback, make sure that it's 1) true, 2) needed, and 3) kind.

## Giving updates
When asking for updates you should aim to have these questions answered:
- Do we (still) understand the "ask" and task at hand?
- What's the expected outcome and quality level?
- How far are we?
- Have we identified any potential blockers, or risks of not meeting the deadline or quality level?
- Do we know who and when to reach out to, in case we need help?

## Setting personal goals
Divide goals into Professional, Business Development, and Leadership.  
To clarify, "Business Development" may also be oriented towards community or internal department.

Then, for each goal set, describe the individual goal in terms of:
- Aspiration  
  What would you like to achieve professionally. Choose only a couple of things that are guaranteed to have high impact on your professional life.
- Actions  
  Write concrete, actionable steps that accelerates you towards your aspirations. Be bold but realistic.
- Measurable outcomes  
  Try to quantify your success. When have you reached your aspirations for this period? Measurable = able to say, “I accomplished x, y, z”.
