# Evaluating Developers

To evaluate other people, you first need to evaluate yourself. 

I don't believe it's possible to find _one true way_ to evaluate everybody, in any culture, setting,
or organization.

In general, evaluate your developers based on:
- The principles they follow
- The practices they apply
- Their sphere of influence
- Their reaction to events
- Their behavior among colleagues and community
- Their attitude towards people, assignments, and the organization

## Red flags

### Knowledge hoarding

### Hiding until perfect

### One-up manship and competitive storytelling

### Not asking questions

## Leaders
