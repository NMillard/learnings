# Notes

## Writing maintainable code
Don't write code that "juniors" can understand. Write code that a qualified person can understand. The qualifications being understanding the language, its idiomatic style, familiarity with the ecosystem, its core libraries, runtime, and build tools - as well as familiarity with the domain you're working in.
You shouldn't "dumb down" the code to make it look and feel like university-level code.
