# SAFe 5.1 Training
Agile at Scale moves from a classical hierachical organization model to a decentralized model where decision making power is given to the teams.  

Agile teams share common features such as: cross-functional, close collaboration, and fast feedback.
Agile development is adaptive, collaborative, iterative, and incremental. This allows the ability to respond to change, customer-centric development, and fast, frequent feedback with built-in quality.

Benefits:
- Faster time to market
- Increased productivity, teams stick together for an extended time
- Quality goes up
- Higher engagement, people become more engaged when autonomy rests at the team level.

### Elements of an Agile Scaling Framework
Teams:   About 5-9 people. Keep small and independent each person with a specific role and set of responsibilities. Distribute work using a backlog.
         User stories exists at the team level and represents features broken into smaller bits.
         A teams has a: product owner, scrum master, and team members.
Program: 5-8 teams. Used as a way to coordinate between teams. There are specific roles and responsibilities at this level. The coordination takes place in an Agile Release Train (ART).
         Coordination is done in Program Increments (PI) every 8-12 weeks. A PI contains 5 iterations (sprints).
         Features exists at the program level.
         A program has: a product manager, system architect, release train egineer (higher level scrum master), business owners (sponsors).
Solution: Used for multiple release trains (solution train). Only needed for very large projects.
          Capabilities encompasses a set of features.
          A solution has: a solution manager, solution architect, and solution train engineer.
Portfolio: Large organizations use portifolio level to manage multiple products.
           Identify value streams and coordinate work in portfolio trains.
           Epics exist at the portfolio level.
           A portfolio has: an epic owners, enterprise architect.
           Uses an Economic framework.
